# Running the Application with Docker Compose

To run the application using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker Compose on your machine if it is not already installed.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the following command to start the application:


```docker compose up -d```


This command will build the Docker images and start the containers in detached mode.

4. Once the containers are up and running, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/docs` in your web browser.
